## Conclusion

This hardware guide provides everything needed to successfully implement the AI Robotics curriculum. The phased approach allows for gradual investment and ensures that students have the right tools at the right time for their learning journey.

Remember that the goal is not to have the most advanced equipment, but to provide students with hands-on experiences that build confidence, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Simple projects completed successfully are more valuable than complex projects that end in frustration.

Regular maintenance, proper organization, and careful inventory management will ensure that the hardware investment provides maximum educational value for multiple cohorts of students.
