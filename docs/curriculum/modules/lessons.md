# 40‑Day AI‑First, Tool‑Driven, Project‑Based Curriculum  
A redesigned curriculum based on **technology grouping**, **AI‑assisted learning**, and **progressive complexity**.  
Topics are merged when they use the same technology family, and separated when they require different tools or ways of thinking.

We start simple, build confidence, and gradually scale into fully integrated app‑cloud‑robot systems.

---

# 🌐 TEACHING MODEL  
- **AI is the primary teacher** (Gemini, ChatGPT, NotebookLM, local LLMs).  
- **We explain languages and tools briefly**, then let students explore deeper with AI.  
- **Robotics hardware concepts are grouped into one day** since they use the same tech.  
- **Differences in tooling = different days** (VS Code web app vs AI Studio web app).  
- **n8n is spread across the course**, not grouped together.  
- **Local LLMs (mobile & PC) get dedicated days**.  
- **Templates start on Day 10**.  
- **Repository cloning begins Day 20**.  
- **Repo creation & branching start Day 30**.
