- *Master the skills to build almost anything you can imagine using AI assistance"*

## 🧠 Concept Discovery: Becoming an AI Whisperer (15 min)

### The Art of Prompt Engineering (10 min)
**What Makes a Good AI Prompt?**

**Bad vs Good Prompts:**
- ❌ "Make code" → ✅ "Make a Python calculator that adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides"
- ❌ "Game" → ✅ "Create a number guessing game where the computer picks a number and the user tries to guess"

**The MAGIC Formula for Perfect Prompts:**
```
"Help me create a [WHAT] in [LANGUAGE] that [DOES WHAT] with [FEATURES]"
```

**Practice Time (5 min):**
Students practice writing prompts for:
- A temperature converter (Fahrenheit to Celsius)
- A simple story generator
- A basic quiz about their favorite topic

**Live Prompt Testing:**
Teacher tests student prompts live on screen and shows different results

### Understanding Different Programming Languages (5 min)
**Quick Tour:**
- **Python:** Great for beginners, like friendly conversation with computer
- **JavaScript:** Makes websites interactive and fun
- **HTML/CSS:** Not really programming, but website styling

**Why We're Starting with Python:**
- Simple syntax (reads almost like English)
- AI loves helping with Python
- Perfect for games and tools

## 🛠️ Hands-On Building: Create Your AI-Powered Tools (40 min)

### Activity 1: The Ultimate Calculator (20 min)
**Challenge:** "Build a calculator that can do everything your phone calculator can do!"

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

**1. Prompt Crafting Challenge (5 min):**
Students write their calculator prompt:
```
"Help me create a calculator in Python that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
It should ask the user for two numbers and what operation they want to do.
Make it user-friendly with clear instructions."
```

**2. AI Collaboration (10 min):**
- Students get their AI-generated code
- Copy into VS Code
- **Debug Together:** Common issues and AI solutions
- Run and test the calculator

**3. Enhancement Time (5 min):**
Ask AI for improvements:
- "How can I make this calculator look better?"
- "Can you add more operations like square root?"
- "Make it show a welcome message"

**Teacher Tip:** Walk around and help students refine their prompts. Celebrate every working calculator!

### Activity 2: Mini Game Creation (20 min)
**Choose Your Adventure:**

**Option A: Number Guessing Game**
```
"Help me create a number guessing game in Python.
The computer picks a number between 1 and 100.
The user tries to guess it, and the computer says too high or too low.
Keep track of how many guesses it takes."
```

**Option B: Rock Paper Scissors**
```
"Create a Rock Paper Scissors game in Python.
The player chooses rock, paper, or scissors.
The computer randomly chooses too.
Determine who wins and keep score."
```

**Option C: Story Adventure**
```
"Help me create a text adventure game in Python.
The player makes choices that affect the story.
Create a simple story about [student's favorite topic]."
```

**Game Development Process:**
1. **AI Prompt Writing (3 min)**
2. **Code Generation & Testing (10 min)**
3. **Game Customization (7 min)** - Add their personality
