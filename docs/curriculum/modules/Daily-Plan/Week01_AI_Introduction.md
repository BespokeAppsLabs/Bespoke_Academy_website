# Week 1 — Introduction to AI, Coding, VS Code, and Robotics

## 🎯 This Week's Mission
_Build your first AI-generated personal website and run your first Python code while discovering how AI tools can become your coding partners!_

## 🔥 Welcome to Bespoke Academy!
**Icebreaker Challenge (5 min):**
*"If you could have an AI assistant help you with any school subject or hobby, what would it be?"*
- Students share their answers
- Teacher writes exciting ideas on the board
- "This week, we'll start building tools to make those ideas real!"

## 🚀 Today's Hook: The "Magic" of AI-Assisted Coding (15 min)

**Live Demo - The 5-Minute Website:**
Teacher shows live creation of a personal website using AI assistance:
1. "AI, help me create a personal website for a 15-year-old who loves gaming"
2. Watch as AI generates HTML/CSS in real-time
3. Quick copy-paste and show the working website
4. "You'll build your own version of this today!"

**The Big Promise:**
*"By the end of today, you will have:*
- *A working personal website that YOU created*
- *Your first Python program running*
- *AI tools ready to help you code anything you can imagine"*

## 🧠 Concept Discovery: Meet Your New Coding Partners (15 min)

### What is AI? (The Simple Version)
**Interactive Discussion:**
- *"Have you used Siri, Alexa, or ChatGPT?"*
- *"What happened when you talked to it?"*
- *"AI is like having a super-smart friend who knows about coding but needs your guidance"*

**AI Partner Exercise (5 min):**
Students try simple prompts:
- "AI, tell me a joke"
- "AI, help me write a story about a robot"
- "AI, explain what a website is"

### What is Coding? (Making Computers Do Things)
**Analogy Time:**
*"Coding is like writing a recipe for a computer. You give it step-by-step instructions, and it follows them exactly."*

**Live Demo:**
```python
# This is like telling the computer:
print("Hello, my name is [your name]!")
print("I'm learning to code with AI help!")
```

### What Can We Build?
**Show & Tell (3 min):**
- Quick examples of student projects from previous years
- Websites, games, robots, apps
- "All of these were built by students just like you!"

## 🛠️ Hands-On Building: Create Your AI-Assisted Website (40 min)

### Setup Your Coding Environment (10 min)
**Step 1: Meet VS Code (Your Coding Workshop)**
- Teacher guides students through opening VS Code
- "This is where all coding magic happens"
- Tour the main features: text editor, terminal, extensions

**Step 2: Meet Your AI Assistant**
- Students open ChatGPT or Gemini in separate tab
- "This is your coding partner - ask it anything!"
- Practice with simple coding questions

### Activity 1: AI-Generated Personal Website (20 min)
**The Challenge:** "Create a website that tells the world about YOU"

**Step-by-Step Guide:**
1. **Prompt Engineering Practice:**
   ```
   "Help me create a personal website. I am [age] years old and I love [hobbies].
   Make it cool and colorful with HTML and CSS."
   ```

2. **Copy, Paste, Customize:**
   - Students get AI-generated code
   - Save as `index.html` in VS Code
   - Change colors, text, add personal details
   - Ask AI for help: "How do I change the background color?"

3. **Make It Work:**
   - Open the HTML file in browser
   - "WOW! It's actually working!"
   - High-fives and celebration

**Teacher Tip:** Walk around and help students craft better AI prompts. Celebrate every working website!

### Activity 2: First Python Code (10 min)
**The Challenge:** "Make the computer say hello to you"

**In VS Code Terminal:**
```python
print("🎉 I'm coding for the first time!")
print("My name is [your name] and I'm awesome!")
age = 15
print(f"I'm {age} years old and ready to build amazing things!")
```

**AI Prompt Help:**
```
"AI, help me write a Python program that tells people about me"
```

## ✨ Creative Challenge: Personalize Your Projects (20 min)

### Website Enhancements (10 min)
**Choose Your Adventure:**
