# PM Agent Assessment Task

## Mission
As the Project Management Agent for Bespoke Academy, conduct a comprehensive assessment of project management effectiveness, delivery readiness, and operational coordination for our AI-powered educational platform.

## Assessment Context
Bespoke Academy is developing an AI-powered educational platform targeting Grades 8-11 students (ages 13-17) and their parents. The project involves curriculum development, website implementation, and market preparation for launch.

## Your Domain Expertise Required
- Project management and coordination
- Resource allocation and timeline management
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Stakeholder alignment and communication
- Quality assurance and delivery processes

## Key Areas to Evaluate

### 1. Project Progress and Timeline Management
**Evidence Sources**:
- `/docs/implementation-plan.md`
- Current git status and development progress
- Milestone completion and timeline adherence
- Development velocity and burndown tracking
**Focus Questions**:
- How effectively is the project progressing toward launch readiness?
- What are the critical path items that could delay launch?
- How accurate are current timeline estimates for remaining work?
- What bottlenecks or blockers are impacting project velocity?

### 2. Resource Allocation and Utilization
**Evidence Sources**:
- Team capacity and workload distribution
- Budget allocation and spending patterns
- Technical resource availability and constraints
- Dependency management and coordination
**Focus Questions**:
- How well are resources (time, budget, personnel) being utilized?
- What resource constraints are impacting project delivery?
- How effective is cross-team coordination and dependency management?
- What additional resources are needed for successful launch?

### 3. Risk Management and Mitigation
**Evidence Sources**:
- Risk identification and assessment documentation
- Mitigation strategy effectiveness
- Contingency planning and preparation
- Issue tracking and resolution processes
**Focus Questions**:
- What risks exist that could jeopardize project success?
- How effective are current mitigation strategies?
- How prepared is the project for unexpected challenges?
- What proactive risk management improvements are needed?

### 4. Stakeholder Alignment and Communication
**Evidence Sources**:
- Stakeholder communication processes
- Decision-making frameworks and authority
- Feedback loops and approval processes
- Cross-functional coordination effectiveness
**Focus Questions**:
- How well aligned are stakeholders on project goals and priorities?
- How effective is communication across different team functions?
- What gaps exist in stakeholder engagement or buy-in?
- How can decision-making processes be improved?

### 5. Quality Assurance and Delivery Standards
**Evidence Sources**:
- Quality control processes and standards
- Testing and validation procedures
- Launch readiness criteria and checkpoints
- Performance metrics and success indicators
**Focus Questions**:
- How robust are quality assurance processes?
- What testing and validation gaps need addressing?
- How clear are launch readiness criteria?
- How will success be measured post-launch?

## Specific Assessment Requirements

### Critical Success Factors:
1. **Timeline Adherence**: On-time delivery of project milestones
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal utilization of available resources
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive identification and management of risks
4. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Unified vision and coordinated execution
5. **Quality Excellence**: High standards maintained throughout delivery

### Red Flags to Identify:
- Timeline delays with no clear recovery plans
- Resource constraints impacting delivery quality
- Unmanaged risks that could jeopardize launch
- Stakeholder misalignment or communication breakdowns
- Quality issues or insufficient testing procedures

## Required Output Format

Follow the standardized assessment template in `/v3/assessment-framework.md`:

1. **Executive Summary** (150-200 words)

   - Resource utilization metrics and constraints
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategy evaluation
   - Stakeholder communication effectiveness review

4. **Gap Analysis**
   - Critical operational gaps that must be fixed before launch
   - Important process improvements for project efficiency
   - Resource or capability gaps that need addressing

5. **Recommendations**
   - Immediate project actions (Next 1-2 weeks)
   - Short-term process improvements (Next 4-6 weeks)
   - Long-term operational strategy (Next 2-3 months)

6. **Risk Assessment**
   - Project risks that could impact launch or success
   - Operational challenges and mitigation strategies
   - Resource constraints and contingency planning
