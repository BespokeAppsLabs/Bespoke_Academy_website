- Educational technology integration
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Key Areas to Evaluate

### 1. Curriculum Framework Quality
**Evidence Source**: `/docs/curriculum/framework.md`
**Focus Questions**:
- Is the "Zero to Hero" approach pedagogically sound for complete beginners?
- Are the 4 progressive phases (Digital Foundations → Electronics → AI → Integration) appropriately structured?
- Is the 40-week timeline realistic for stated learning outcomes?
- How well does the framework support diverse learning styles?

### 2. Learning Progression Analysis
**Evidence Sources**: `/docs/curriculum/modules/` directory
**Focus Questions**:
- Does the scaffolded learning progression build skills effectively?
- Are the weekly learning objectives aligned with long-term outcomes?
- How appropriate are the activities for the 13-17 age range?
- What gaps exist in the learning progression?

### 3. AI Integration Pedagogy
**Evidence Sources**:
- `/docs/curriculum/ai_personalization_framework.md`
- `/docs/AI_Integration_Guide.md`
**Focus Questions**:
- How effectively does AI integration enhance rather than complicate learning?
- Are the AI tools age-appropriate and safely implemented?
- How well does the methodology teach AI literacy versus AI dependency?

### 4. Assessment and Feedback Systems
**Evidence Source**: `/docs/curriculum/assessment_feedback_system.md`
**Focus Questions**:
- How well do assessment methods measure actual learning outcomes?
- Is the "no grades" approach effectively implemented?
- How meaningful are the alternative assessment strategies?
- How does the feedback system support student growth?

### 5. Accessibility and Inclusion
**Evidence Source**: `/docs/curriculum/accessibility_inclusion_validation.md`
**Focus Questions**:
- How well does the curriculum support diverse learners?
- What accommodations exist for different learning needs?
- How inclusive is the content and teaching methodology?
- How WCAG 2.1 AA compliant are the educational materials?
