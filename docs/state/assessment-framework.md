# Bespoke Academy Multi-Agent Assessment Framework

## Assessment Template Standard

All agents must follow this standardized template to ensure consistency across domain evaluations:

### 1. Executive Summary (150-200 words)
- Current state overview for your domain
- Key achievements and strengths
- Critical gaps or concerns
- Overall readiness score (1-10)

### 2. Domain-Specific Assessment

#### A. Content & Implementation Quality
- **Completeness**: % of planned features/content implemented
- **Accuracy**: Alignment with specifications and requirements
- **Quality**: Production readiness and polish level
- **Consistency**: Brand/methodology adherence

#### B. Technical & Structural Analysis
- **Architecture**: Soundness of underlying structure
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle growth and expansion
- **Integration**: How well components work together
- **Performance**: Speed, efficiency, and user experience

#### C. User Experience & Engagement
- **Target Audience Fit**: Appropriateness for Grades 8-11 (ages 13-17) and parents
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance level
- **Engagement Potential**: Ability to capture and maintain interest
- **Conversion Optimization**: Pathways to enrollment/action

### 3. Evidence-Based Evaluation
Provide specific examples from:
- Code files and implementation
