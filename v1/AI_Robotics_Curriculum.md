# High School AI & Robotics Curriculum (40 Weeks)

This curriculum is designed to introduce high school students to the exciting world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics. It combines theoretical foundations with hands-on practical activities to ensure students not only understand the concepts but also apply them in real-world contexts. The program is divided into four main phases across 40 weeks.
