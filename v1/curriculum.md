# Comprehensive Coding & AI Curriculum

This document outlines a **highly detailed curriculum** designed to take students from
absolute beginners to confident developers and AI explorers. It is structured in a modular,
progressive way so that students can **join mid-year** and still catch up quickly with
provided onboarding materials. Each week contains learning goals, hands-on projects, and
support resources.

---

## 1. Introduction & Philosophy of the Course

- **Hands-on learning** from day one: every week includes small projects.
- **Gradual skill-building**: start with the basics (variables, loops) before moving into
  complex topics like APIs and AI tools.
- **No initial repository needed**: first weeks are offline/local exercises to build
  confidence.
- **Progressive exposure to repositories**: starter kits and codebase navigation begin
  around Week 5–6.
- **AI and open-source libraries** introduced later in the program to help students
  understand real-world coding practices.
- **Onboarding support**: new students get a dedicated 3–4 week catch-up track.
